# GZCLP Routine Overview

GZCLP (Cody LeFever's Linear Progression) is a beginner-friendly linear progression program based on the GZCL method. It's designed for lifters who want structured progression on the four main barbell lifts.

## Core Principles

### The Tier System

Every workout consists of three tiers of exercises:

| Tier | Purpose | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **T1** | Primary strength | Heavy compound lift, low reps, high intensity |
| **T2** | Volume/hypertrophy | Secondary compound lift, moderate weight, higher reps |
| **T3** | Accessories | Isolation/assistance work, light weight, high reps |

### The Pyramid Principle

As intensity increases, volume must decrease. This creates a sustainable training base while allowing for heavy strength work.

## Workout Structure

### Four-Day Rotation

The program cycles through four workouts (A1, A2, B1, B2). You train 3 days per week with at least one rest day between sessions.

| Workout | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|
| **A1** | Squat | Bench Press | Lat Pulldown |
| **A2** | Overhead Press | Deadlift | Dumbbell Row |
| **B1** | Bench Press | Squat | Lat Pulldown |
| **B2** | Deadlift | Overhead Press | Dumbbell Row |

**Example Schedule:**
- Week 1: Mon (A1), Wed (A2), Fri (B1)
- Week 2: Mon (B2), Wed (A1), Fri (A2)
- ...and so on

## Sets, Reps, and Progression

### T1 Exercises (Primary Lifts)

**Starting Scheme:** 5 sets × 3 reps (last set is AMRAP)

| Stage | Sets × Reps | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | 5×3+ | Starting point |
| Stage 2 | 6×2+ | After failing 5×3 |
| Stage 3 | 10×1+ | After failing 6×2 |

**Rest Time:** 3-5 minutes between sets

**Progression:**
- Add **5 lbs** per session for upper body (Bench, OHP)
- Add **10 lbs** per session for lower body (Squat, Deadlift)

### T2 Exercises (Secondary Lifts)

**Starting Scheme:** 3 sets × 10 reps

| Stage | Sets × Reps | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Stage 1 | 3×10 | Starting point |
| Stage 2 | 3×8 | After failing 3×10 |
| Stage 3 | 3×6 | After failing 3×8 |

**Rest Time:** 2-3 minutes between sets

**Progression:** Half of T1 (2.5 lbs upper / 5 lbs lower, or 1.25/2.5 kg)

### T3 Exercises (Accessories)

**Scheme:** 3 sets × 15+ reps (last set is AMRAP)

**Rest Time:** 1-1.5 minutes between sets

**Progression:** Increase weight by smallest increment when you hit **25+ reps** on the AMRAP set

## Handling Failure

### T1 Failure Protocol

1. **Fail at 5×3?** → Keep same weight, switch to 6×2+
2. **Fail at 6×2?** → Keep same weight, switch to 10×1+
3. **Fail at 10×1?** → Test new 5RM (or use estimated 5RM), restart at 85% of new 5RM with 5×3

### T2 Failure Protocol

1. **Fail at 3×10?** → Keep same weight, switch to 3×8
2. **Fail at 3×8?** → Keep same weight, switch to 3×6
3. **Complete 3×6 cycle?** → Return to 3×10 with 15-20 lbs added to your last 3×10 weight

### What Counts as Failure?

- **T1:** Unable to complete all required sets/reps (excluding AMRAP)
- **T2:** Unable to complete all required sets/reps

---

## AMRAP Sets

The "+" notation means "As Many Reps As Possible" on the final set.

**Guidelines:**
- Leave 1-2 reps in reserve (don't go to absolute failure)
- Maintain good form throughout
- Use AMRAP performance to gauge if weight is appropriate

---

## Starting Weights

Choose weights you can comfortably handle for the required sets/reps with good form. It's better to start too light than too heavy—linear progression will catch up quickly.

**General recommendation:** Start with weights you could do for 8+ reps if needed.

## Adding More T3 Exercises

Once comfortable with the base program, you can add 1-2 additional T3 exercises per workout. Common additions:

- Face pulls
- Bicep curls
- Tricep extensions
- Leg curls
- Ab work

## Summary

| Tier | Starting Scheme | Rest | Progression | Failure Protocol |
|------|-----------------|------|-------------|------------------|
| T1 | 5×3+ | 3-5 min | +5/10 lbs per session | 5×3 → 6×2 → 10×1 → test 5RM → reset |
| T2 | 3×10 | 2-3 min | +2.5/5 lbs per session | 3×10 → 3×8 → 3×6 → reset |
| T3 | 3×15+ | 1-1.5 min | +weight at 25 AMRAP reps | N/A |
